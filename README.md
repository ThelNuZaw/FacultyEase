# Objective
The goal of this project is to create FacultyEase, a desktop program that optimizes and arranges faculty office hour scheduling and administration. Common problems including conflicting appointments, ineffective time management, and misunderstandings between students and faculty are addressed by the program. It will give faculty an easy-to-use interface to enter courses, manage time slots, specify semester specifics, and keep track of student appointments. The system enables fundamental functions like search, edit, and reporting and guarantees data reliability through flat files.
